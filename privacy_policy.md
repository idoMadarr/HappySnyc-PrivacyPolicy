**Privacy Policy for HappySync – Facebook Birthday Sync**

_Last updated: 26/02/2026

HappySync (“we”, “us”, or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you use our Chrome extension HappySync (the “Extension”).

### 1. Information We Collect

**Facebook Birthday Data**  
When you manually trigger the synchronization process, HappySync reads birthday information (names and dates) from the Facebook birthdays page that you have access to. This information is collected only with your explicit consent and only when you initiate the process.

**Google Account Information**  
To sync birthdays to your Google Calendar, HappySync uses the Chrome Identity API to obtain your authorization to access your Google Calendar. We do NOT store your Google login credentials; access is granted via OAuth tokens.

### 2. How We Use Your Information

The birthday data is transmitted to our secure backend server at: https://chrome-extension-server-happysync.onrender.com/


for the purpose of creating calendar events in your Google Calendar.

This data is used solely to perform the synchronization operation you requested. We DO NOT share, sell, or use your birthday data for marketing or any purpose beyond the functionality of this extension.

### 3. Data Storage and Retention

Collected birthday data is:

- Temporarily stored on your device using `chrome.storage.local`.
- Transmitted to our backend server only when you initiate a sync.
- Used solely to create calendar events.
- Not retained longer than necessary to complete the sync operation.

Your birthday data is NOT permanently stored by the extension unless you choose to retain it in your calendar.

### 4. Third-Party Services

This extension uses:

- **Facebook**: to access your birthdays page when you trigger a sync.
- **Google Calendar API** via OAuth to add events to your calendar.

We do not share your data with other third parties.

### 5. User Controls

You may revoke access at any time by:

- Removing the events from your Google Calendar.
- Resetting extension data via Chrome settings.
- Revoking Google Calendar access via your Google account settings.

### 6. Security

We take reasonable steps to protect your information during transmission. However, no internet transmission is completely secure.
